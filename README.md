This is a collection of modules that share an important part between them, even across bombs. Build files and manuals are in releases for now. Once the pack is released on steam, this will be updated to direct you there instead

Feedback should be left in the Wind-Up Modules Beta Thread in #mod-creation in the unnoficial KTANE server: https://discord.gg/K6uQMyBcYZ
