X - Completed (Could need a reword)
/ - In Progress
! - Needs Rework

---Known Issues---
Safe has no solution method, simply showing the correct code

Wind the Key uses a scuffed system to determine the target time, needs a minimum module cap, and the fake light still doesn't switch to the solve light's model in game

Lockpick's manual looks bad

Maze is a little complicated and maybe not worded super well.

Music Box's music is WAY too loud and a skip button needs to be added so the defuser doesn't have to wait to submit the code

The only module with TP support is timer

None of the SVGs are done. The appendix also needs a rewrite
